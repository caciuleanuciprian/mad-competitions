            example by using a Cookie) or use resources (for example by running
            a script) on a User’s device as they interact with this Application.
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize={"sm"}>
            For simplicity, all such technologies are defined as "Trackers"
            within this document – unless there is a reason to differentiate.
            For example, while Cookies can be used on both web and mobile
            browsers, it would be inaccurate to talk about Cookies in the
            context of mobile apps as they are a browser-based Tracker. For this
            reason, within this document, the term Cookies is only used where it
            is specifically meant to indicate that particular type of Tracker.
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize={"sm"}>
            Some of the purposes for which Trackers are used may also require
            the User's consent. Whenever consent is given, it can be freely
            withdrawn at any time following the instructions provided in this
            document.

            otherwise specified within this document, third-party providers may
            access the Trackers managed by them.

          <Text fontSize={"sm"}>
            The validity and expiration periods of Cookies and other similar
            Trackers may vary depending on the lifetime set by the Owner or the

            There are various ways to manage Tracker related preferences and to

          </Text>
          <Text fontSize={"sm"}>
            Users can manage preferences related to Trackers from directly
            within their own device settings, for example, by preventing the use
            or storage of Trackers.
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize={"sm"}>
            Additionally, whenever the use of Trackers is based on consent,
            Users can provide or withdraw such consent by setting their
            preferences within the cookie notice or by updating such preferences
            accordingly via the relevant consent-preferences privacy widget, if
            available.
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize={"sm"}>
            It is also possible, via relevant browser or device features, to
            delete previously stored Trackers, including those used to remember
            the User’s initial consent preferences.
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize={"sm"}>
            Other Trackers in the browser’s local memory may be cleared by
            deleting the browsing history.
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize={"sm"}>
            With regard to any third-party Trackers, Users can manage their
            preferences via the related opt-out link (where provided), by using
            the means indicated in the third party's privacy policy, or by
